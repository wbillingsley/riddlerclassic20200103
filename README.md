# A riddler Classic solution, 3 Jan 2020

This is a hastily written solution to [this puzzle](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/can-you-solve-the-vexing-vexillology/)
on fivethirtyeight.com 

The puzzle relates to the New York Times's "Spelling Bee" puzzle. To mix it up a little, the riddler puzzle removes the
letter 'S' from valid selections, and asks which selection of letters gives the maximum total possible score.

The code is not beautifully written - don't expect my best code. It's just a quickly-written solution to a one-time puzzle.
(Bugs are also a possibility.)

The code is in src/main/scala/spellingbee/solver.

The output from running the code (on a fairly old underpowered computer) is in src/main/resources/out.txt
